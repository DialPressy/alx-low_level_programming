Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly.

The following are tasks to be completed:

Task 0 - Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0. 

Files: 0-main.c, main.h

Task 1 - Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
File: 1-main.c

Task 2 - This program prints the largest of three integers.
File: 2-largest_number.c, main.h

Task 3 - This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
File: 3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h
